# AssistAI_Public
This is a side project I've been working on. It's a voice activated virtual assistant AI, with a notable real-time translation feature.

List of features:  
-Capable of answering any query with a dynamic chat mode  
-Opens various apps like command prompt, notepad, and steam  
-Tells you your IP address when prompted  
-Capable of using google and wikipedia to get information  
-Capable of playing youtube videos  
-Can tell you the date and time  
-Can tell you the news  
-Can tell you jokes, the mood, and its identity  
-Can tell you the weather of any city  
-Translates in real time via voice prompts      

# Installation  
-MUST HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED ON YOUR PC!!!!  
-Download Zip file from GitHub and extract the Zip file (If you already have the files then skip this step)  
-To install required plugins, navigate to the directory on a command line (ex. "cd {FILE PATH}) and type "pip install -r requirements.txt"    
-Next, run the AssistAI.exe file.    

This should allow you to run the program!  

# How to Use:
